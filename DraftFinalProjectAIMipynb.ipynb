One approach is to completely retrain the chef from scratch to learn Chinese cuisine. However, this would take a lot of time and effort. Instead, you just teach the chef some specific recipes and techniques that are unique to Chinese cuisine, building on their existing knowledge of cooking. This approach is much faster and efficient. In machine learning, this process is akin to fine-tuning. You take a model that's already trained on a broad task (like the chef trained in Italian cuisine) and tweak it slightly to perform well on a more specific task (like cooking Chinese cuisine).\n",
            "\n",
            "### Introduction to QLoRA\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, let's introduce QLoRA into our analogy. Imagine the kitchen our chef works in is suddenly restricted in space and resources. The chef can't use all the fancy equipment and ingredients they're used to; they need to work efficiently with limited resources while still producing delicious meals. In the machine learning world, this scenario is similar to deploying models on devices with limited memory and processing power, like smartphones or small sensors. They can't handle the large, complex models we'd typically use on powerful servers. \n",
            "\n",
            "QLoRA is a technique that helps our \"chef\" (the model) adapt to working in this smaller \"kitchen\" (the device with limited resources) by focusing on the most critical \"recipes and techniques\" (parameters of the model) that are necessary for making \"delicious meals\" (making accurate predictions). It does so by quantizing and adapting only certain parts of the model in a low-rank manner, which essentially means finding the simplest, most efficient version of the model that still performs the task well.\n",
            "\n",
            "### How QLoRA Works\n",
            "\n",
            "Imagine if our chef decides to use a simplified set of kitchen tools that are essential for most Chinese dishes and learns to use them in the most efficient way possible, disregarding the rest. They might also use ingredients that are versatile and can be used across many dishes. In QLoRA, quantization is like picking the essential tools and ingredients - it reduces the \"size\" of the model by simplifying the numbers it uses to make calculations. The low-rank adaptation is like learning to use those tools in the most efficient way possible - it modifies the model slightly to ensure it can still perform well on the new cuisine despite the simplified toolkit.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Implementing QLoRA\n",
            "\n",
            "Implementing QLoRA involves two main steps:\n",
            "1. **Quantization**: This process simplifies the model by reducing the precision of the numbers it uses. Imagine telling our chef to use only half a dozen types of kitchen tools instead of dozens. This step makes the model much smaller and faster to run, but it could make it less accurate or versatile if not done carefully.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Low-Rank Adaptation**: After quantization, some of the model's \"cooking skills\" might not be as sharp as before. To address this, low-rank adaptation tweaks the model's parameters (or its \"cooking techniques\") slightly to make the best use of its simplified toolkit. It's like our chef finding new shortcuts or techniques to make dishes taste great even with fewer tools and ingredients.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Conclusion\n",
            "\n",
            "QLoRA is a clever technique for making machine learning models more efficient, allowing them to run on devices with limited processing power without a significant loss in performance. It's like teaching an expert chef to work in a smaller kitchen with fewer tools and ingredients, yet still produce delicious meals. Understanding and implementing QLoRA can be challenging, but it's a powerful tool in the world of machine learning, especially for applications where resources are limited.\n"

With this focus, gather a set of 10 to 15 high-resolution images. These images should not only be clear and relevant to your theme but also varied. Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning a model refers to the process of taking a pre-trained model (model trained on some big, public corpus) and further training it on a new, smaller dataset or with a specific ... The model you finetuned stored the LORA weights separately, so first you need to merge it with base model so you can have one model that contains both the base model and your finetune on top of it. lit-gpt already comes with scripts to do that. python scripts/merge_lora.py \\. Fine-Tuning, LoRA and QLoRA. In the realm of language models, fine tuning an existing language model to perform a specific task on specific data is a common practice. This involves adding a task-specific head, if necessary, and updating the weights of the neural network through backpropagation during the training process. It is important to ... November 24th, 2023. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method is a fine-tuning method introduced by a team of Microsoft researchers in 2021. Since then, it has become a very popular approach to fine-tuning large language models, diffusion models (such as for image-generation), and other types of AI models.
