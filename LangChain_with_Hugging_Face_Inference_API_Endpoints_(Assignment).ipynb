It is based on the concept of using low-rank matrices in conjunction with quantization techniques to reduce the computational complexity of LLMs, allowing for faster and more efficient fine-tuning. QLoRA has the potential to significantly improve the performance of LLMs, particularly in terms of resource utilization and performance improvement.'"
